# **React Website Lab - Save State & Add Global Context**  

This lab builds on the **multi-page React website** from before. Now, we’re making it **smarter** by adding:  

✅ **Local Storage** (so state survives refreshes)  
✅ **`useEffect`** (to sync state with storage)  
✅ **React Context API** (to manage state across components)  

---

## **🛠️ Setup**  
1️⃣ **Go to your project folder**  
```bash
cd lectureCodeReactBasics
```  
2️⃣ **If you don’t have a React app yet, create one**  
```bash
npx create-react-app .
```  
3️⃣ **Replace your old `App.js`**  
```bash
mv ~/Downloads/App.js src/App.js
```  
4️⃣ **Run the app**  
```bash
npm start
```  

---

## **📖 What You’ll Build**  
A **multi-page website** that now:  
✅ **Remembers your last visited page** (even after refresh)  
✅ **Saves dark mode preference**  
✅ **Uses Context API for cleaner state management**  

---

## **🔧 Try This**  
- **Add more settings to local storage** (like font size or username).  
- **Improve styling** (make the UI look better).  
- **Track how many times each page is visited** and store it.  

---

## **📌 For Instructors**  
- Show **how `useEffect` + local storage keeps data between refreshes**.  
- Explain **why Context API is better than prop-drilling**.  
- Let students **tinker and break things to learn**.  

---

## **🚀 Next Steps**  
- Learn **React Router** for better navigation.  
- Use Context API for **managing more global state**.
